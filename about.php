				<p>In 1990 I was born on the Isle of Wight, it is there where my interest and passion for Musical Theatre began, at the young age of 4 years old. From then until the age of 18 I have belonged to countless music theatre and dance groups on the Isle of Wight, where I took part as both a performer, a member of the production team and theatre committees.</p>
				<p>In 2008 I achieved two A-levels in Theatre Studies and English Literature and a Btec diploma (A-level equivalent) in Dance. Throughout the years, I have also attended weekly private singing lessons, competed and won various dance and music festivals as well as completing many I.S.T.D and B.T.D.A dance examinations in Modern, Jazz and Tap. I have also undertaken the role of teaching assistant of many dance and acting lessons throughout various local schools and have recently given lectures to sixth form Performing Arts students in how to research performing arts schools, audition for a place and survive professional performing arts training.</p>
				<p>In 2001 I was nominated for the Jeremy Irons award for "Best Young Actress" for my performance in Annie.</p>
				<p>Some of my main lead roles in non-professional shows include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Les Mis&eacute;rable (schools edition) - as the character of Eponine</li>
					<li>Annie - as the character of Annie</li>
					<li>Babes in Arms - as the character of Susie Ward</li>
					<li>Grease - as the character of Marty</li>
					<li>The Boyfriend - as the character of Dulcie</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In 2008 I moved to London and began my professional training in "Dance and Musical Theatre" at Millennium Performing Arts, where I am studying under the board of Trinity for a Level 6 National Diploma, equivalent to a First Degree.</p>
				<p>I've enjoyed my time at Millennium and it has helped me prepare for industry performing.</p>
				<p>I am due to graduate June 2011 and am planning to complete a Masters in Arts Policy and Management at a university in London.</p>
				<p>My dance, acting and music skills are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ballet</li>
					<li>Contemporary Dance, in both Graham and Cunningham technique</li>
					<li>Jazz Dancing, in Matt Mattox technique, lyrical, modern, commercial and hip hop</li>
					<li>Tap</li>
					<li>Pas de Deux</li>
					<li>Cabaret Dancing</li>
					<li>Acting, Meisner and Stanislavski technique</li>
					<li>Music Theatre Singing</li>
